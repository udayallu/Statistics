# Statistics

## Random Variable 
A random variable Assigns a numerical values to each possible outcome of a random experiment.
### Are these a random variables ?
1. Todays weather ( Not RV)
2. The number of millimeters of rainfall tomorrow in Redmond ( IS RV)
3. The color of a car choosen at random ( not RV)
4. If 1 is the next car will see is blue , 2 if its is green ,4 if it is black ( is RV)
5. Price of stock ( not yesterdays price but tomorrows price)

## Random variables comes in 2 flavours 
1. Discrete
2. Continous 

### Discrete - A Discrete random varaible is as a number of outcomes we can count.
Computing the mean 
Outcome x      Probability
10               1/6
20               3/12
30               1/12
40               1/6
50               1/6
60               1/6

Mean (U) = 10x1/6 + 20x3/12 + 30x1/12 ..... 60x1/6=34.1667
Visulizing is better way to see the values distributed.

Measuring the spread of the Random variable
outcome xi - mean 
mean square varaince=(xi-u)wholew squre

X     P
0   .03
1   .14
2   .35
3   .32
4   .15
5   .01
=.03x(0-2.45)^2 + ....... .01x(5-2.45)^2
=1.0675

STANDARD DIVIANCE = SQURE ROOT OF VARAINCE 
=SQRT(1.0675)=1.0332


### Continous- A Continous random variables is diffrent, we cant count the ammount the possiblities.
