# Statistics

## Random Variable 
A random variable Assigns a numerical values to each possible outcome of a random experiment.
### Are these a random variables ?
1. Todays weather ( Not RV)
2. The number of millimeters of rainfall tomorrow in Redmond ( IS RV)
3. The color of a car choosen at random ( not RV)
4. If 1 is the next car will see is blue , 2 if its is green ,4 if it is black ( is RV)
5. Price of stock ( not yesterdays price but tomorrows price)

## Random variables comes in 2 flavours 
1. Discrete
2. Continous 

### Discrete - A Discrete random varaible is as a number of outcomes we can count.
Computing the mean 
1. Outcome x      Probability
2. 10               1/6
3. 20               3/12
4. 30               1/12
5. 40               1/6
6. 50               1/6
7. 60               1/6

Mean (U) = 10x1/6 + 20x3/12 + 30x1/12 ..... 60x1/6=34.1667
Visulizing is better way to see the values distributed.

Measuring the spread of the Random variable

1. X     P
2. 0   .03
3. 1   .14
4. 2   .35
5. 3   .32
6. 4   .15
7. 5   .01
=.03x(0-2.45)^2 + ....... .01x(5-2.45)^2
=1.0675

STANDARD DIVIANCE = SQURE ROOT OF VARAINCE 
=SQRT(1.0675)=1.0332



## The Bernoulli Distribution

A binomial distribution can be thought of as simply the probability of a SUCCESS or FAILURE outcome in an experiment or survey that is repeated multiple times. 
The binomial is a type of distribution that has two possible outcomes (the prefix “bi” means two, or twice). For example, a coin toss has only two possible outcomes: heads or tails and taking a test could have two possible outcomes: pass or fail.


## Binomial distributions must also meet the following three criteria:

1. The number of observations or trials is fixed. In other words, you can only figure out the probability of something happening if you do it a certain number of times. This is common sense — if you toss a coin once, your probability of getting a tails is 50%. If you toss a coin a 20 times, your probability of getting a tails is very, very close to 100%.
2. Each observation or trial is independent. In other words, none of your trials have an effect on the probability of the next trial.
3. The probability of success (tails, heads, fail or pass) is exactly the same from one trial to another.

## Poisson distribution 
A Poisson distribution is a tool that helps to predict the probability of certain events from happening when you know how often the event has occurred. The Poisson distribution gives us the probability of a given number of events happening in a fixed interval of time.

### Continous- A Continous random variables is diffrent, we cant count the ammount the possiblities.

A continuous random variable is a random variable where the data can take infinitely many values. For example, a random variable measuring the time taken for something to be done is continuous since there are an infinite number of possible times that can be taken.

In this way, z measures how many standard deviations X is
above or below the mean.
